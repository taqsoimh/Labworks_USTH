# HEY, READ FIRST PLS!!

#### Exercise 2: Write a C program to enter a positive integer number n and calculate the sum of even and odd numbers from 1 to n.

I will do this exercise in 3 ways:
1. USING MATH (GOOD)
2. USING FOR LOOP (GOOD but not as good as method 1)
3. ARRAY (??? I do it in this method because the labwork related to ARRAY lmao)
